                  <p>From parks like the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakehshore to the most beautiful sights in the Upper Peninsula northern Michigan in the summertime is incomparable. If you are in Ann Arbor, you should definitely take a day to check it out. Tons of places like traverse city and mackinaw island are Michigan staples.</p>

                  <h3>Hawaii</h3>
                  <p>Hawaii might have been my favorite place ever. I say that about a lot but truly I have never felt at such peace than when I was hearing the waves crash along the shore and eating monkey break in a little cafe. If it isn’t obvious I love warm weather, and this was absolutely perfect. I tried surfing here, and there’s volcanos. I really would like to come back here.</p>

                  <p>Vermont is one of those places that people never think of when thinking about where they should plan their next vacation. I never would have either if I did not have a friend living there. I was in awe of its beauty. The trees; Quichee Jorge- Tons of natural beauty I never even knew existed. A true gem in the U.S.</p>

                  <p>I went to Italy for a few days in high school and I had such an unforgettable time. Going with friends, we got to take a pasta making class and a dance class and it was so fun. We visited Florence and Venice and seeing the canals and unique archetecture was very cool. I would like to visit Rome and see more culutral sights if I could go again.</p>
